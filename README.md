Main Ingredients in Joint Genesis
---------------------------------

In the following section, we will break down the science behind each Joint Genesis ingredient:

[![](https://i.ibb.co/B27kGjN/2-Joint-Genesis-Reviews-Scam-Alert.jpg)](https://snoppymart.com/joint-genesis)

*   **Boswellia Serrata –** Boswellia serrata is considered an effective treatment for osteoarthritis because of its anti-inflammatory effects. Seven trials including 545 test subjects were reviewed by the NIH and the evidence showed that Boswellia significantly reduced joint pain for most of the patients.

*   **Hyaluronic Acid –** Hyaluronic acid is a compound found naturally in the joints. Studies have found that this is a necessary compound for normal joint function because it helps keep the joints lubricated.

*   **Ginger –** In a study highlighted by Versus Arthritis, it was shown that a ginger group (compared to a placebo group) reported significant decreases in knee pain. As we can see in the following quote, ginger has great potential in reducing joint pain caused by arthritic conditions. “63% of the participants who were treated with ginger had significant reduction in knee pain compared to 50% of the placebo group.The severity of pain and overall improvement of osteoarthritis-related symptoms were also significantly reduced in the group taking ginger compared to the placebo group.”

*   **Pepper –** Pepper is included in the [**Joint Genesis formula**](https://groups.google.com/g/biodynamix-joint-genesis-unveiled/c/b4vOln-tOos) as Bioperine. Bioperine is a treated extract of black pepper fruit and is included in this formula to make the other ingredients more bioavailable.

*   **Pine Bark –** In a study cited on the Versus Arthritis website, it was found that pine bark is rich in flavonoids which have potent antioxidant effects. The study showed that pine bark not only relieved joint pain and stiffness; but swelling as well.
